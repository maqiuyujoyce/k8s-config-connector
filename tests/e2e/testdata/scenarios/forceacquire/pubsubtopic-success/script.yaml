# Step 1: Create PubSubTopic with specific retention
apiVersion: pubsub.cnrm.cloud.google.com/v1beta1
kind: PubSubTopic
metadata:
  name: pubsubtopic-success-1-${uniqueId}
spec:
  resourceID: pubsubtopic-success-${uniqueId}
  messageRetentionDuration: "600s"

---

# Step 2: Abandon it (leaves GCP resource)
TEST: ABANDON
apiVersion: pubsub.cnrm.cloud.google.com/v1beta1
kind: PubSubTopic
metadata:
  name: pubsubtopic-success-1-${uniqueId}
spec:
  resourceID: pubsubtopic-success-${uniqueId}
  messageRetentionDuration: "600s"

---

# Step 3: Force Acquire with matching spec (Success - verifies existing GCP resource)
#TEST: APPLY-10-SEC
TEST: APPLY
apiVersion: pubsub.cnrm.cloud.google.com/v1beta1
kind: PubSubTopic
metadata:
  name: pubsubtopic-success-2-${uniqueId}
  annotations:
    cnrm.cloud.google.com/force-acquire: "true"
spec:
  resourceID: pubsubtopic-success-${uniqueId}
  messageRetentionDuration: "600s"

---

# Step 4: Verify Abandon on Delete (Delete with Force Acquire)
TEST: DELETE
apiVersion: pubsub.cnrm.cloud.google.com/v1beta1
kind: PubSubTopic
metadata:
  name: pubsubtopic-success-2-${uniqueId}
  annotations:
    cnrm.cloud.google.com/force-acquire: "true"
spec:
  resourceID: pubsubtopic-success-${uniqueId}
  messageRetentionDuration: "600s"

---

# Step 5: Verify GCP resource still exists (Re-acquire normally)
# _http04.log should only contain a GET call, and this confirms Step 4 didn't delete the GCP resource.
TEST: APPLY

# Step 6: Normal Cleanup (Delete)
TEST: DELETE
