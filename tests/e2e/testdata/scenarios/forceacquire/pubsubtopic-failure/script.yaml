# Step 1: Create PubSubTopic
apiVersion: pubsub.cnrm.cloud.google.com/v1beta1
kind: PubSubTopic
metadata:
  name: pubsubtopic-failure-1-${uniqueId}
spec:
  resourceID: pubsubtopic-failure-${uniqueId}
  messageRetentionDuration: "600s"

---

# Step 2: Abandon it
TEST: ABANDON
apiVersion: pubsub.cnrm.cloud.google.com/v1beta1
kind: PubSubTopic
metadata:
  name: pubsubtopic-failure-1-${uniqueId}
spec:
  resourceID: pubsubtopic-failure-${uniqueId}
  messageRetentionDuration: "600s"

---

# Step 3: Force Acquire with Drift (Failure)
# Drift: spec says 700s, live is 600s. Should be NotReady (UpdateFailed).
# Use APPLY-10-SEC to allow controller to attempt to reconcile and report error,
# then capture the object state.
TEST: APPLY-10-SEC
apiVersion: pubsub.cnrm.cloud.google.com/v1beta1

spec:
  resourceID: pubsubtopic-failure-${uniqueId}
  messageRetentionDuration: "700s"

# Step 4: Cleanup (Delete K8s object, should abandon because of force-acquire logic even if it failed verification)
# Shouldn't make any HTTP request, i.e. no _http03.log.
TEST: DELETE
