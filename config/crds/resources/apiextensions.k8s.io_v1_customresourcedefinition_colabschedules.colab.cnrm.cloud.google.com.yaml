                                             one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent

                                             (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).

                                             In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they
                                             expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the
                                             scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type
                                             server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:

                                             * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.
                                             * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                                               value in binary format, or produce an error.
                                             * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                                               URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                                               lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                                               on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                                               breaking changes.)

                                             Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official
                                             protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with
                                             type.googleapis.com.

                                         one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent
                                         the fully qualified name of the type (as in
                                         `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form
                                         (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).

                                         In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they
                                         expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the
                                         scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type
                                         server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:

                                         * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.
                                         * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                                           value in binary format, or produce an error.
                                         * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                                           URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                                           lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                                           on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                                           breaking changes.)

                                         Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official
                                         protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with
                                         type.googleapis.com.

                                         Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

                                         the fully qualified name of the type (as in
                                         `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form
                                         (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).

                                         In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they
                                         expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the
                                         scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type
                                         server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:

                                         * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.
                                         * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                                           value in binary format, or produce an error.
                                         * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                                           URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                                           lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                                           on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                                           breaking changes.)

                                         Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official
                                         protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with
                                         type.googleapis.com.

                                         Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be
                                         used with implementation specific semantics.
